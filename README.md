### Outline
The COVID-19 pandemic was a major public health crisis that began in 2020. It shut down most of the world for 2-3 years and its impacts are still being studied today. The United States had a disjointed response to the pandemic that varied by State and, in some cases, Municipality. The date range we exmaine ranges from 2020 till the end of 2023. Below is a brief time of the pandemic:

- January 20, 2020: CDC reports the first laboratory-confirmed case of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus in Washington state.
- March 11, 2020: World Health Organization (WHO) declares pandemic.
- March 13, 2020: U.S. declares national emergency.
- June 10, 2020:  COVID-19 cases in the U.S. surpasses 2 million.
- September 22, 2020: The reported death tolld in the U.S. from COVID-19 surpasses 200,000.
- December 11, 2020: FDA issues Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine - the first vaccine approval.
- December 14, 2020: U.S. begins administering vaccines. National COVID death toll surprasses 300,000
- March 13, 2021: More than 100 million COVID vaccine doses have been administered in the U.S.
- May/April 2022: United States COVID-19 death toll surpasses 1,000,000.
- April 10, 2023: POTUS terminates the national emergency related to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
- May 5, 2023: WHO declares end of pandemic phase.
